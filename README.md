# Front End Course Exercises

Exercises for the Frontend Web Development Course. Each exercise must be completed when instructed to do so by your instructor(s) or by the material.

### INSTRUCTIONS

- If you haven't done it already, fork this repository and add your instructor(s) as collaborator(s) to your forked repository.

- **Sync your forked repo with the original repo (IMPORTANT)** in order to pull from the original repo whenever it gets updated. Here are the steps:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SocialHackersAcademy/FrontEndCourseExercises/  (Run this just once)

git fetch upstream

git checkout main

git merge upstream/main
```

- Create a new branch for each exercise and create a Pull Request back to your main branch **on your own repository**. Make sure to assign your instructor(s) and ask for a review on the Pull Request. Submit the Pull Request URL to the Quiz.
The URL should look like this: `https://github.com/kostasx/FrontEndCourseExercises/pull/1` where `kostasx` will be your GitHub username.

```diff
! IMPORTANT: You will need to create a Pull Request merging back into your own repository's main branch and NOT the main repository (SocialHackersAcademy).
```

- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help.

You can check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGmEE-UDgWI) that walks you through the process of forking the exercises repo, working on a branch and doing a PR.

### FAQ

- Question: _In the Repo we only do the exercises it tells us to and ignore the other exercises inside, correct? For example I am doing JS Fundamentals 2, I should ignore the CSS Grid one_
  - Answer: **Yes, that's correct. You will have to work on the exercise(s) you are instructed to on each lesson.**
