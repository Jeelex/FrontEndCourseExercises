      <p>
        Tinos, known as the island of Arts and Culture, constitutes the center of marble
        craftsmanship in modern Greece and the motherland of numerous local craftsmen and acclaimed
        artists of the past and present times. As such, it offers the visitors the opportunity to
        discover its rich heritage through museums, art exhibitions, archaeological and religious
        sites, as well as through the living tradition of the active marble quarries, the marble
        workshops of the northern villages and the classrooms of the Preparatory and Professional
        School of Fine Arts of Pyrgos.

      <h3>Santorini</h3>

      <p>
        Santorini is considered to be the most sought after place for a romantic getaway in Greece,
        since there are not many places in the world where you can enjoy exquisitely clear waters
        while perched on the rim of a massive active volcano in the middle of the sea! The island
        has a growing reputation as a “wedding destination” for couples not only from Greece but
        from all over the world. A trip to Santorini with the other half is a dream for anyone who
        has seen at least one photo of the island’s famous Caldera and exchanging kisses beneath
        Santorini’s famous sunset is the ultimate romantic experience!

      <h3>Lesvos</h3>
      <img src="/images/lesvos-island.jpg" alt="Lesvos island" />
      <p>
        The lush, green island of Lesvos, or Mytilini as it is also called, is like no other Greek
        island and perhaps no other place in the world. It is the third largest of the islands in
        Greece behind Crete and Evia. Virtually unaffected by the mass tourism that has turned other
        islands into amusement parks, Lesvos is the perfect place to visit for people who want to
        experience the real Greece. For the Greek Island traveler who is worried about not having
        enough to do, Lesvos is the perfect destination with amazing food, beautiful beaches, pine
        and hardwood forests, rivers and over a million olive trees
