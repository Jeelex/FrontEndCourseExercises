    <p>
      Tinos, known as the island of Arts and Culture, constitutes the center of marble craftsmanship
      in modern Greece and the motherland of numerous local craftsmen and acclaimed artists of the
      past and present times. As such, it offers the visitors the opportunity to discover its rich
      heritage through museums, art exhibitions, archaeological and religious sites, as well as
      through the living tradition of the active marble quarries, the marble workshops of the
      northern villages and the classrooms of the Preparatory and Professional School of Fine Arts
      of Pyrgos.

    <p>
      Santorini is considered to be the most sought after place for a romantic getaway in Greece,
      since there are not many places in the world where you can enjoy exquisitely clear waters
      while perched on the rim of a massive active volcano in the middle of the sea! The island has
      a growing reputation as a “wedding destination” for couples not only from Greece but from all
      over the world. A trip to Santorini with the other half is a dream for anyone who has seen at
      least one photo of the island’s famous Caldera and exchanging kisses beneath Santorini’s
      famous sunset is the ultimate romantic experience!

    <h3>Lesvos</h3>

    <p>
      The lush, green island of Lesvos, or Mytilini as it is also called, is like no other Greek
      island and perhaps no other place in the world. It is the third largest of the islands in
      Greece behind Crete and Evia. Virtually unaffected by the mass tourism that has turned other
      islands into amusement parks, Lesvos is the perfect place to visit for people who want to
      experience the real Greece. For the Greek Island traveler who is worried about not having
      enough to do, Lesvos is the perfect destination with amazing food, beautiful beaches, pine and
      hardwood forests, rivers and over a million olive trees
